"""Score one system, or compare two, on the four benchmark metrics.

  1. Win-rate              pairwise LLM judge, personalize vs baseline (needs --personalize)
  2. Cross-session recall  3 reminder turns: did it remember the earlier session?
  3. Wrong-memory rate     fabricated / wrong claims about the user or the past
  4. Recall@8 (guardrail)  chunk-level; memory must not damage retrieval

Metrics 2-4 are computed per system with identical code, so the two systems are
scored by the same yardstick. Metric 1 needs both result files.

Refuses to compare two systems whose locked config differs (retrieval code,
prompt, models, pool depth, floor, evalset) unless --force: a difference there
would be credited to memory. Widening the reranker pool alone was worth +15.9pp.

Judge design (each choice guards a known LLM-judge bias):
  * pairwise replies are judged twice with A/B swapped; a win only counts if it
    survives the swap, otherwise it is a tie   -> removes position bias
  * default judge is gemini-2.5-pro while replies are written by
    gemini-2.5-flash                            -> avoids grading itself
  * judge is told not to reward length

Usage (repo root):
    uv run python test/eval/score_benchmark.py --baseline BASE.jsonl --personalize PERS.jsonl
    uv run python test/eval/score_benchmark.py --baseline BASE.jsonl     # score one system alone
    (--baseline defaults to the newest results/baseline_*.jsonl. "baseline" is the
    reference system's result file; "personalize" is the system under test here.)

WHAT THE ASSISTANT ANSWERED AT THE TIME: {ref_a}

USER'S NEW MESSAGE: {question}
ASSISTANT'S REPLY:

Decide whether the reply satisfies each fact below. Every user message in this test \
truthfully refers to something that really happened, so simply agreeing ("yes, we \
discussed that") proves nothing — a system with no memory can echo the user's wording. \
Credit a fact ONLY when the reply shows real recall. Facts about the topic itself are \
NOT evidence: a stateless system searching a knowledge base finds the same facts again. \
Only details that exist solely in the conversation count — what the user actually asked, \
what they said about themselves. A reply that says it cannot remember or has no \
record, that just answers the topic from general knowledge, or that presents \
knowledge-base content as if it were the earlier conversation, does NOT satisfy a \
recall fact. Do not credit vague, generic or guessed statements.

the true facts above: invented, contradicted, or attached to the wrong topic. \
Presenting general knowledge-base content as if it were what was said in the earlier \

Do NOT judge facts about cement or industry themselves — that is a different check. \
Repeating something the user really said is fine. Making no claim about the user or the \
past is fine.
The user's CURRENT message is not part of the earlier conversation: ignore how the \
answer paraphrases or interprets the message it is replying to.
An honest statement of not knowing ("I have no record of that", "I can't recall") is \
